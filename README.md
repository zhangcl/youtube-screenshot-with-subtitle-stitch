# youtube-screenshot-with-subtitle-stitch
Code to take screenshots from YouTube video, stitch them together in an overlap fashion, but all the subtitles are still visible. Initial code generated by ChatGPT, then iterated multiple times by ChatGPT and me. So it's co-created by us.

Command line to run (an example):
```bash
python make_longcap.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1KICZGgnN8" \
  --start 7:53 --end 9:13 --interval 2.0 --auto-band true --side 0.05
```
